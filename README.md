# Language Locker

**Language Locker** is a Visual Studio extension that prevents switching of keyboard layout (e.g. English to Russian) while working in Visual Studio.

It does not affect language switching in other applications.

Select **Tools** and then **Unlock Keyboard Language** to allow language switching in Visual Studio.

**Install extension** directly from Visual Studio using the" Extensions and Updates" dialog, or **download VSIX package** from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vurdalak1.languagelocker).
