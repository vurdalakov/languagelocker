# Language Locker

**Language Locker** is a Visual Studio extension that prevents switching of keyboard layout (e.g. English to Russian) while working in Visual Studio.

It does not affect language switching in other applications.

Select **Tools** and then **Unlock Keyboard Language** to allow language switching in Visual Studio.
